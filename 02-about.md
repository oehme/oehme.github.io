My name is Stefan Oehme and I love making other people more productive.

I'm an independent software developer, specializing in developer productivity and performance. 
I previously was an engineer at [Gradle](https://gradle.org), working both on the open source build tool and enterprise offerings. 

In my free time I enjoy bouldering, RPGs and of course spending time with my wife and friends.
