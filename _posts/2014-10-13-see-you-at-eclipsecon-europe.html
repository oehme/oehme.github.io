<a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2014/">EclipseCon Europe</a> is just around the corner, so it is time for some shameless self-promotion ;)&nbsp;Among the many awesome talks on <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend </a>and <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/">Xtext </a>will also be one given by me and my colleague <a href="http://zarnekow.blogspot.de/">Sebastian Zarnekow</a>.<br /><br /><h4><a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2014/session/new-noteworthy-xtend">Tue 16:45 to 17:20: New &amp; Noteworthy in Xtend</a></h4><div>In this overview we will show you many great features that were added in the 2.6 and 2.7 releases. Among them are inner classes, swifty lambda sugar and improved operator overloading. The small standard library also got some often requested additions as well as cool new Active Annotations. Of course itâ€™s not only the language itself but also the Eclipse based IDE, that got a lot of attention. It comes with better performance, more powerful code analysis, organize imports on packages, improved template proposals and a revised outline view.<br /><br />You will also get  a glimpse at what we have planned for the future, like the long anticipated IntelliJ support and faster builds. And of course you can get in touch with us at the itemis booth. I'm looking forward to see you there!</div>
